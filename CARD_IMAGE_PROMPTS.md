 # Dragon Riders Card Image Prompts
 
 ## Baseline Style Prompt
 Take inspirations from other table-top card games like Magic the Gathering, Pokemon, or any others. The general setting of the game is a gritty, dirty, world in which Dragonriders are freely independent to defend their interests and when they stumble across another Dragonrider it almost always leads to conflict (the gameplay). Artwork should not only represent the character themselves, but the background of their image or any other sort of "flare" within the image should be indicative of their background. You should understand the character just be looking at their art work, even before you read the card. This art style should be remembered and assumed for all work on this game - we're just going to tackle the characters one at a time. Refer back to what you know about these characters and the game (both gameplay and technically).
 
 ## Card Prompts
 
### Strike (Dragon Damage, red)
 Prompt: Create a dynamic, close-quarters dragon attack that is quick and precise. Show a dragon rider's weapon or dragon claws striking the enemy dragon’s armored scales, with sparks and a shallow impact crater to communicate moderate damage. Background should hint at a dirty battlefield skirmish, fast motion lines, and a sense of tempo.
 
### Heavy Blow (Dragon Damage, red)
 Prompt: Depict a slow, devastating hit against an enemy dragon. Show a massive weapon or a dragon’s crushing limb slamming down, shattering rock and armor plates, with debris flying to show heavier damage. Background should feel brutal and weighty, like a ruined arena or cliffside.
 
### Burning Hit (Dragon Damage, orange)
 Prompt: Show a single attack that lands and ignites the enemy dragon. Visualize a weapon or dragon strike trailing flame that bites into scales, leaving a glowing burn wound and embers in the air. Background should feel smoky, scorched, and oppressive.
 
### Weakening Strike (Rider Damage, red)
 Prompt: Illustrate a rider-focused attack that saps strength. Show a rider being struck in a way that staggers them, with a visible loss of resolve or posture. Use visual cues like dimming light, frayed banners, or a cracked visor to imply weakened morale and capability.
 
### Precision Strike (Rider Damage, red)
 Prompt: Show a clean, surgical hit on an enemy rider. Visualize a precise blade, arrow, or spear that hits a critical point, with minimal collateral damage. Background should emphasize focus and skill, like a tight corridor or a narrow pass.
 
### Crippling Blow (Rider Damage, rose)
 Prompt: Depict a brutal strike that leaves the enemy rider wounded and impaired. Show a rider brought to one knee, clutching an injured limb, with torn armor and blood on stone. Background should be harsh and unforgiving, highlighting the lasting injury.
 
### Chain Bolt (Multi-Target, indigo)
 Prompt: Create a lightning strike that arcs from the enemy dragon to the enemy rider. Show a crackling bolt hitting the dragon and then chaining in a thinner arc to the rider, with a visible intensity difference. Background should feel storm-lashed and electrical.
 
### Dual Strike (Multi-Target, violet)
 Prompt: Show a single attack that hits both the enemy dragon and rider. Visualize a sweeping slash or shockwave that clips the dragon’s flank and the rider beside it. Background should feel chaotic but balanced, suggesting split damage.
 
### Freeze Ray (Control, cyan)
 Prompt: Depict a chilling beam or blast that freezes the enemy dragon in place. Show frost spreading across scales, ice crystals forming, and the dragon’s breath hanging in the air. Background should be cold, brittle, and pale with rime.
 
### Rider Immobilize (Control, cyan)
 Prompt: Show a control effect that freezes or binds the enemy rider. Visualize ice binding the rider’s legs or a frost aura locking their movement. Background should emphasize stillness and a sudden, oppressive chill.
 
### Energy Drain (Control, purple)
 Prompt: Illustrate a siphoning effect that pulls energy from the opponent. Show glowing energy strands being extracted from the enemy rider or dragon into the caster’s hand or device. Background should feel like a vacuuming pull, dimming around the target.
 
### Sabotage (Control, pink)
 Prompt: Depict a covert disruption of the opponent’s resources. Show a hooded rider cutting pouch straps, scattering cards or scrolls, or poisoning supplies. Background should convey stealth, shadows, and sudden loss.
 
### Shield Up (Defense, blue)
 Prompt: Show a defensive surge that grants shields to the dragon. Visualize glowing plates or a magical barrier snapping into place over the dragon’s body. Background should feel resolute, with protective light and a defensive stance.
 
### Shield Disruptor (Defense, gray)
 Prompt: Depict a device or strike that shatters magical shields on an enemy dragon. Show energy shields cracking and fragmenting into shards of light, exposing scales beneath. Background should feel disruptive, like a resonance wave rippling outward.
 
### Dragon Heal (Healing, green)
 Prompt: Show restorative magic mending the dragon’s wounds. Visualize soft, warm light knitting torn scales and closing wounds, with steam rising as vitality returns. Background should feel hopeful and steady amid grit.
 
### Rider Heal (Healing, green)
 Prompt: Depict a rider being stabilized and restored. Show a healer’s glow or elixir sealing cuts and lifting the rider’s posture. Background should communicate relief and renewed focus without losing the gritty tone.
 
### Energy Surge (Utility, yellow)
 Prompt: Show a burst of raw energy flowing into the caster. Visualize crackling power around hands or runes, with energy spiraling upward. Background should feel like a power spike, intense and bright against the dark setting.
 
### Thaw (Utility, teal)
 Prompt: Illustrate a thawing effect that breaks freeze and draws a new card. Show frost melting off a dragon or rider, with a fresh card or rune emerging from steam. Background should include a subtle sense of momentum returning.
 
### Firebreak (Utility, amber)
 Prompt: Depict a cleansing effect that removes all burn from dragon and rider. Show flames being smothered by a sudden wave of ash, water, or warding fire that burns clean and leaves no embers. Background should show a calm after the scorch.
 
### Energy Shield (Utility, sky)
 Prompt: Show a protective ward that prevents the next status effect on the dragon. Visualize a translucent, rune-etched barrier forming over the dragon, with icons for frost, flame, and lightning fading as they approach. Background should feel vigilant and anticipatory.
